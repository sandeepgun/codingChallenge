1.)Design and Implementation

I designed 2 java classes one class is Randomizer which has the 
logic to generate random numbers and 

the other class PrimeRandomizer to check for a number to be prime 
or not and returns a queue that has the number
and a boolean value stating the number is prime or not.


2.)Sample output


413305 is not prime number

The original number in que is :413305

The boolean value stating whether the original number in the queue is prime or 

not and if flag is true number is not prime and if flag is false number is prime    true

3.)Implemented using 2 classes and the code can be found.
